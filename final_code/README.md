# Statistics behind Spotify :: a nonparametric approach to music

## File organization

* `API/`: Python code to download data from Spotify's API.
* `datasets/`: all `.csv` files used and generated by the project.
* `plots/`: figures are stored in subdirectories named after the R script which generated the figures.
* `scripts/`: "support" scripts containing useful functions (mostly wrappers for ggplot2).
* `stats/`: main directory for the project
  * R scripts are numbered and named with an `s` prefix.
  * Each script saves the data needed by following scripts in an `.RData` file with the same name but a `d` prefix.

## Required libraries

Scripts will generally assume the availability of the following libraries (all available on CRAN):

* `ggplot2` for plotting,
* `patchwork` for combining ggplots in a grid,
* `aplpack` for bagplots,
* `DepthProc` for depth measures,
* `splines` for spline regression,
* `mgcv` for GAMs.
