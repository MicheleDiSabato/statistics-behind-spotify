### `ETS_price_prediction`

The aim of this paper is to examine what drives the changes in price of carbon credits in the European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and to make predictions based on these relationships. The study is based on dataset from the United Kingdom (UK) energy market and global equity indices. The large dataset is reduced in dimension using correlation analysis and predictions are then made by multiple linear regression. Certified emission reduction units (CERs) are shown to be the only same-day market relationship which provides useful predictions of European Union Allowance prices (EUAs). No significant correlation is found between EUAs and the UK power market and the theoretical price of carbon credits; switching price, is shown to be a poor indicator of the price of carbon credits.

### `lobbying_and_fraud`

This paper examines the relation between corporate lobbying and fraud detection. Using data on corporate lobbying expenses between 1998 and 2004, and a sample of large frauds detected during the same period, we find that firms’ lobbying activities make a significant difference in fraud detection: Compared to nonlobbying firms, on average, firms that lobby have a significantly lower hazard rate of being detected for fraud, evade fraud detection 117 days longer, and are 38% less likely to be detected by regulators. In addition, fraudulent firms on average spend 77% more on lobbying than nonfraudulent firms, and they spend 29% more on lobbying during their fraudulent periods than during nonfraudulent periods. The delay in detection leads to a greater distortion in resource allocation during fraudulent periods. It also allows managers to sell more of their shares.

### `swedish_vol_LOB`

The publicly available electronic limit order book at the Stockholm Stock Exchange consists of five levels of prices and quantities of a given stock with a bid and ask side. All changes in the book during one day can be recorded with a time quote. Studying the variation of the quoted price returns as a function of quantity is discussed. In particular, discovering and modelling dynamic behaviours in the volatility of prices and liquidity measures are considered. Applying a functional approach, estimation of the volatility dynamics of the spreads, created as differences between the ask and bid prices, is presented through a case study. For that purpose two-step estimation of functional linear models is used, extending this method to a time series context.

### `greenium`

This study provides evidence on the existence of a negative greenium, i.e. a risk premium related to the greenness of a firm, based on European individual stock returns. We define a priced ‘greenness and transparency’ factor based on companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and the quality of their environmental disclosures, and show that what is priced by the market is the combination of environmental performance and environmental transparency. Based on this factor, we offer a tool to assess the exposure of a portfolio to the risk associated with the low-carbon transition, and hedge against it. We estimate that in a stressed scenario where greener and more transparent firms very much outperform brown stocks, there would be losses at the global level, including for European large banks, should investors fail to price climate- transition risks. These results call for the introduction of climate stress tests for systemically important financial institutions.

### `smart_work_covid`

The paper discusses the extent of teleworking in the EU before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, develops a conceptual analysis to identify the jobs that can be done from home and those that cannot, and on this basis quantifies the fraction of employees that are in teleworkable occupations across EU countries, sectors and socio-economic profiles. Using the occupational task descriptions provided in the Italian Indagine Campionaria delle Professioni, with additional indicators from the European Working Conditions survey, we estimate that 37% of dependent employment in the EU is currently teleworkable – very close to the estimates of teleworking indicated in real-time surveys during the COVID-19 crisis. Because of differences in the employment structure, the fraction of telewokable employment ranges between 33-44% in all but five EU member states. Even starker differences in teleworkability emerge between high- and low-paid workers, between white- and blue-collar workers, as well as by gender. Results suggests that that the large expansion of telework since the COVID-19 outbreak has been strongly skewed towards high-paid white-collar employment.
